This is the README for Sced, a constraint based scene editor, or authoring
tool if you're into VRML.

Sced is a program for creating 3d scenes, then exporting them to a wide
variety of rendering programs. Programs supported are:
 POVray, Rayshade, any VRML browser, anything that reads Pixar's RIB
 format, and Radiance. Plus a couple of local formats, for me.

Sced uses constraints to allow for the accurate placement of
objects, and provides a maintenance system for keeping this
constraints satisfied as the scene is modified.

Compiling it:
Gunzip and untar the distribution. Try:
  zcat sced-1.03.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
or
  tar -xzvf sced-1.03.tar.gz

Run ./configure in the sced-1.03 directory that is created. Answer the
questions asked (most are answered for you). A "path" should be a
full pathname, starting at /. "Options" is a list of options you want
passed to a renderer when previewing (only when previewing). So
an example for POV is:
  POVray path []? /usr/local/bin/x-povray
  POVray options []? -l/usr/local/lib/povray +d3 +ftga
Answer y or n to the yes/no questions.

The default installation directory root is /usr/local (so the executable goes
in /usr/local/bin). If you don't like this, then run:
  configure --prefix=/your/install/dir

Run "make depend".

Run "make".

Run "make install". This puts the executable in /usr/local/bin (or whereever
you specified with --prefix to configure) and the man page in
/usr/local/man/man1.

With a bit of luck it will all work. If it doesn't the first place to
look is in the Makefile AFTER running configure. If there's anything
there that looks strange, try fixing it. If you can't figure out what's
wrong, mail me and ask. If you can figure out what's wrong, mail me
and tell me.

Common problem:
Configure does not do a good job of detecting lex/flex libraries.
If you get an error message regarding "yywrap", you should try
changing the line in the Makefile (after running configure) that says:
 LEXLIB=
to say
 LEXLIB=-lfl
or
 LEXLIB=-ll
whichever works.

Setting Up:
A sample defaults file is in sced-1.0/scenerc.  Edit this to suit your
needs and copy it to $HOME/.scenerc. If you want to set the X resources
then do that via your normal method. Details on the defaults file and
Xresources are in the user guide, provided as docs/guide.dvi. Run dvips
to turn it into postscript for printing or viewing.

Running it:
That's the easy part. Just type sced.
Try loading some of the scenes provided.
