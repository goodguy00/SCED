#Sced, a constraint based scene editor
###Version 1.03

Sced is a program for creating 3d scenes, then exporting them to a wide variety of rendering programs. Programs supported are:
* POVray, Rayshade, any VRML browser, anything that reads Pixar's RIB
* format, and Radiance. Plus a couple of local formats, for me.

Sced uses constraints to allow for the accurate placement of objects, and provides a maintenance system for keeping this constraints satisfied as the scene is modified.

After some few changes, compiling Sced under openSuse Leap 42.3 was successful.
* git clone the project
* there is no configure, so change parameters directly in Makefile (like path to powray)
* make

There is some documentation, which i copied from a Sceda project (animation with Sced), but the basics of the little quirky UI are common. I'm planning to rewrite Sced completely.
